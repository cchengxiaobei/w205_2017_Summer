I query the average score for each hospital from effective care table and the average HCAHPSBaseScore from surveys response table. Then I joined the result together and get the top 10 hosptials with the most averge quality scores. From the result below we can not say these two scores has obvious correlation. Then I run the same query without limiting the result and only calculate the correlation. The result is around -0.286 which aligns with our observation.
